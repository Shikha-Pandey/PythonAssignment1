    "\n",
    "     a) int-It contains positive or negative whole numbers (without any fraction or decimal no) eg-a= 2,34, b=2889 etc\n",
    "     b) float- It contains decimals. eg. a=2.45,b=7.98 etc\n",

    "     \n",
    "     a) Sring-The string can be defined as the sequence of characters represented in the quotation marks. In Python, we can use         single, double, or triple quotes to define a string.eg- a=\"Python\",b= \"1\",c='1.8'.\n",
    "     b) List- List is a ordered collection of data.The items stored in the list are separated with a comma (,) and enclosed             within square brackets [].eg- list1  = [12, \"hi\", \"Python\", 2].\n",
    "     c) Tuple -  tuples also contain the collection of the items of different data types. The items of the tuple are separated           with a comma (,) and enclosed in parentheses ().We can't modify the size and value of the items of a tuple. \n",

The result of this type of expression is also a numeric value. The operators used in these expressions are          arithmetic operators like addition, subtraction, etc. \n",
    "      3. Integral Expressions: These are the kind of expressions that produce only integer results after all computations and            type conversions.\n",
    "      4. Floating Expressions: These are the kind of expressions which produce floating point numbers as result after all                computations and type conversions.\n",
    "      5. Relational Expressions: In these types of expressions, arithmetic expressions are written on both sides of relational            operator (> , < , >= , <=). Those arithmetic expressions are evaluated first, and then compared as per relational                operator and produce a boolean output in the end. These expressions are also called Boolean expressions.\n",
    "      6. Logical Expressions: These are kinds of expressions that result in either True or False. It basically specifies one or          more conditions. For example, (10 == 9) is a condition if 10 is equal to 9. As we know it is not correct, so it will            return False.\n",
